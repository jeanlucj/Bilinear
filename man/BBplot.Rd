\title{BBplot function}
\usage{
BBplot(bilinearObject, f = 0.5, nPC = NULL, plottitle = "Biplot",
  biplot3D = FALSE, outer.box = TRUE, internal.axes = FALSE,
  scaled = TRUE, decorateGGE = FALSE, Gnames = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bilinearObject}{object from output of a call to biliner()}

\item{f}{numeric. Scale parameter in (0, 1) for exponent on eigenvalues for weighting the genotype scores. Environment scores are weighted 1 - f. Default is 0.5}

\item{nPC}{integer. Number of principal components to graph in the model. Default is 2 for a 2D biplot and 3 for a 3D biplot. If the number of significant PCs is less than the default and no argument is provided to 'nPC', the mean will be printed on the x axis, and the 1st (or 1st and 2nd for 3D biplot) PC will be printed on the remaining axis(es)}

\item{plottitle}{character. Title for biplot.}

\item{biplot3D}{logical. Should a 3dimensional}

\item{outer.box}{logical. Shoudl a box be printed around the plot. default is TRUE.}

\item{internal.axes}{logical. For 3D biplots(?) default is FALSE}

\item{scaled}{logical. default is TRUE}

\item{decorateGGE}{logical. should a GGE plot be decorate to dilineate megaenvironments to determine genotype winners?}

\item{Gnames}{character vector of genotype names to be included on plot near respective points}
}
\description{
This function makes biplots from a bilinear() object, and is a wrapper for decorateBBplot.
